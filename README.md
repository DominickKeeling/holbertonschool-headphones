## Project Overview

In this project, we will create a responsive webpage using HTML and CSS. The goal is to ensure that the webpage looks and functions well on different devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. The webpage will adapt to varying screen sizes and orientations, providing an optimal user experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Development Environment**: Ensure you have a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) installed to work on the project.

3. **HTML and CSS**: Create HTML and CSS files for your webpage. Organize your project structure as needed.

4. **Styling**: Develop styles that enhance the visual appeal and usability of your webpage. Pay attention to fonts, colors, layouts, and other design elements.

## Responsive Design

We will implement responsive design techniques to cater to various screen sizes:

- **Desktop Version**: Create styles for larger screens with appropriate fonts, layouts, and visuals.
- **Tablet Version**: Use media queries to adjust styles for tablets, ensuring content is well-structured and readable on medium-sized screens.
- **Mobile Version**: Implement styles for smaller screens, optimizing content layout for a mobile-friendly experience.

The following are common practices for responsive design:

- Use media queries to apply different styles based on screen width.
- Utilize relative units (e.g., percentages, ems) for responsive font sizes and spacing.
- Test your webpage on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
